					<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line an 8 x 8 pan with foil or parchment paper and then spray with nonstick spray (I use a coconut oil based spray that I love.)
In a bowl place 1 cup of chocolate chips or chopped and measured dark chocolate.
Microwave the coconut oil and measure the coconut oil in its melted, hot state.
Pour the hot melted coconut oil over the dark chocolate and stir the chocolate until it is completely melted.
For best results I suggest using LouAna coconut oil as I've found other coconut oils vary in their baked taste and sometimes result in a bitter-tasting baked good.
Add in the Greek yogurt. Make sure the Greek yogurt is quite thick (check the notes) and not watery. If needed drab it with a paper towel after stirring and measuring it.
Stir in the vanilla, salt, baking soda, and coconut sugar.
In a blender or food processor put in quick oats or old fashioned oats. Blend or process until the oats resemble flour. Measure the oat flour after blending and not before.
Stir into the mixture. Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup chocolate chips.
Spread the mixture (it is very thick) into the prepared 8 x 8 pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 28-32 minutes or until a fork comes out clean when inserted.
Do not over-bake. Slightly under-baking is better and will yield a better taste and texture. (More fudge-like)
Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.
Optional frosting
In a microwave safe bowl combine the chocolate chips and milk. Microwave in bursts of 15 seconds, stirring for 15 seconds in between each burst until the chocolate is completely melted.
Stir in the Greek yogurt and then whisk in the powdered sugar.
Start with 3/4 a cup and add as needed. Note that the frosting thickens up a lot after being refrigerated.
Refrigerate the frosting (covered in an airtight container) for at least 30 minutes.
Cover the brownies with the frosting.
Remove the brownies using the overhang of the parchment paper or foil. Cut into pieces and enjoy.</p>
