					<p><b>Instructions</b>:</p>
Egg Mixture:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and grease a 9x13 in baking pan with cooking spray.
Whisk together eggs and egg whites in a large bowl. Set aside.
Heat olive oil in a large non stick pan over medium heat.
Add in onions and saute for about 5 minutes.
Add in broccoli, mushrooms, and spinach cook for another 4 minutes, or until veggies are tender.
Add in garlic and saute for another 30 seconds.
Season with salt and pepper.
Mix with eggs and pour into prepared baking pan.
Bake in preheated oven for 20-30 minutes, or until the eggs have fully cooked through.
Use a glass (or some sort of circle cutter) to cut eggs into a circle the size of your english muffins.
Have leftover scrapes? Use them for another breakfast sandwich, eat them plain for breakfast, or mix them into something else for a meal!
Eat immediately option:
Toast english muffins to your liking.
Place cheese on one side and turkey on another.
Broil in the oven until cheese is melty and the turkey has warmed through.
Top with cut out eggs and enjoy!
Eat later that week option:
Store cooked eggs in an airtight container in the fridge and assemble the morning of!
Freezer friendly option:
Toast the english muffins.
On the bottom half of the english muffin, top with egg circle, then cheese and turkey.
Top with the top of the english muffin.
Repeat with remaining english muffins/eggs/turkey/cheese.
Wrap each sandwich individually in aluminum foil.
Place sandwiches in a freezer bag.
Freeze for up to one month!
To reheat: Remove sandwich from foil. Place on a microwave safe plate that's been lined with a paper towel. Heat until egg has been warmed through and cheese is melty, about 60-90 seconds.
