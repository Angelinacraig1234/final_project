                take the supplements required. Taking vitamins help:</p>

                       <ul>
                          <li>improve skin</li>
                          <li>increase energy</li>

                   <p>When talking about the amount of calories you need to take everyday you have to keep in mind everyone is different.
                The amount of calories needed depends on your
                      <ul>
                         <li>age</li>
                         <li>height</li>
                         <li>gender</li>
                         <li>daily activity level</li>
                         <li>depending on if you want to maintain, gain or lose weight</li>
                      </ul>                         
                
                <br>
                
                   <p>When it comes to snacks you want to make sure you stay away from junk food. So put down those chips and swap them for 
                a healthy alternative. If you're craving something sweet go for fruits, fruits give you many health benefits. You can also 
                have a salad if craving something semi salty. If you don't have any of those things available you can eat granola or granola bars.
                Make sure that these granola bars are low in calories.</p>     
                
                <br>
                
                   <p>Exercise, that dreaded word many of us don't like. The thing is exercise depends your age and weight. You don't necessarily
                have to do intense work outs. You can go for a walk for a certain amount of time. You can do so many things for example 
                instead of taking the bus or a taxi to a short destination you can walk to the area. </p>
                
                <br>
                
                   <p>When eating you should'nt eat past 9 because that can cause over eating and it wouldnt give your body enough time to 
                digest.Sleep is very important. The amount of sleep would show throughout the day and make sure to get as much sleep as possible.
                It is good to get at least 8 hours of sleep. Sleep is very important for growth in adolescence</p>
