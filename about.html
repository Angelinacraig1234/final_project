                   <p> Adolescence is a time of growth for children, for both physical and mental development. 
               A healthy diet is essential for teenagers because of their heightened nutritional needs,
               but also because the foods they eat as teenagers can impact their health when they reach adulthood.
               Healthy eating also promotes good food habits to last a lifetime.</p>
               
				   <p>Here are some Tips to Stay Healthy!!</p>
                   
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   
				   <p>Try to drink 8 cups of water everyday. Even though we may not need 8 cups of water it definetly helps</p>
                   
                      <ul>
                         <li>balance maintain</li>
                         <li>balance of body fluid</li>
                         <li>clearer skin</li>
                         <li>things flow easier</li>
                         <li>calorie control</li>
                      </ul>
                   <p>If you are not too fond of drinking water you can add fruit and mint to it, it definetly enhances the water. There 
                is a recipe for this in our recipe section.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                   <p> Make sure your body gets the vitamins it needs. If you have any dietary restrictions or health problems
                take the supplements required. Taking vitamins help:</p>
                
                      <ul>
                          <li>support healthy aging</li>
                          <li>boost energy levels</li>
                          <li>detox your body</li>
                          <li>improve your skin</li>    
                          <li>boost mood</li>
                          <li>manage stress</li>
                      </ul>
                      
                   <p>When taking vitamins, make sure to add fish oil. Fish oil has been proven to</p>
                       <ul>
                          <li>improve skin</li>
                          <li>increase energy</li>
                          <li>lifts depression</li>
                          <li>thickens hair</li>
                       </ul>
                       
                   <p>When talking about the amount of calories you need to take everyday you have to keep in mind everyone is different.
                The amount of calories needed depends on your
                      <ul>
                         <li>age</li>
                         <li>height</li>
                         <li>gender</li>
                         <li>daily activity level</li>
                         <li>depending on if you want to maintain, gain or lose weight</li>
                      </ul>                         
                
                <br>
                
                   <p>When it comes to snacks you want to make sure you stay away from junk food. So put down those chips and swap them for 
                a healthy alternative. If you're craving something sweet go for fruits, fruits give you many health benefits. You can also 
                have a salad if craving something semi salty. If you don't have any of those things available you can eat granola or granola bars.
                Make sure that these granola bars are low in calories.</p>     
                
                <br>
                
                   <p>Exercise, that dreaded word many of us don't like. The thing is exercise depends your age and weight. You don't necessarily
                have to do intense work outs. You can go for a walk for a certain amount of time. You can do so many things for example 
                instead of taking the bus or a taxi to a short destination you can walk to the area. </p>
                
                <br>
                
                   <p>When eating you should'nt eat past 9 because that can cause over eating and it wouldnt give your body enough time to 
                digest.Sleep is very important. The amount of sleep would show throughout the day and make sure to get as much sleep as possible.
                It is good to get at least 8 hours of sleep. Sleep is very important for growth in adolescence</p>
 
                    <p> 
                    A good way to reinvent your diet is to watch your family's eating habits and stray away from the negative parts of it.
                    I noticed most of the food my family bought was processed,ready made and heavy in calories and fat. To have those types of meals once in a while is fine,
                    But if your main diet consists of ready made food thats a big sign of unhealthy living.
                    now of course your family may be too busy to cook,or ready made meals/fastfood may be a cheaper alternative for some. 
                    But here are ways to curv your home eating habit while also being affordable.   </p>
<ul>
                <li> Ask for a weekly, two weekly or monthly food allowance to buy your own groceries and cook your own food.
                    *It’ll teach you responsibility,help you learn how to cook and you 
                    could even sometimes cook for your family as well.</li>
                <li>If your parents can’t afford to give you your own food allowance.Look up some food pantries ,especially one's with fresh produce.Stray away from canned and processed food.
                    Look out for veggies and other goodies that you can surely use to make a tasty meal.
                    *Take a bus,train,walk or ask for a ride.make sure to bring along a carriage of empty big plastic/cardboard box </li>
                <li>Get a job! 
                    If you’re between the ages of 15-18 odds are you can scavenge for a job.Try to stay away from fast food places because you’ll more likely have accessible junk food.
                    But that extra money can give you money to buy the types of food you want.
                    *If you’re having a hard time finding a job ask around to trusted adults and friends. 
                    There are also jobs online such as craigslist (beware of sketchy places and make sure its an actual established place before going to an address or giving out any personal information) 
                    and facebook groups with jobs locally near you. </li>
</ul>

                <p> Eating healthy at school! I go to school in a city,so every corner is filled with yummy 
                    resturaunts.But because of my student budget I tended to eat at places for cheap eats but high in calorie and fat intake.
                    I'm talking about dollar slices,7/1 slushies,yummy deli bacon and cheese,and other meat sandwhichs. 
                    Especially since i never really enjoyed school lunch i would buy expensive meals.
                    Here are ways to eat cheap and save your appetite for later. </p>
<ul>
                <li>Bring a minimum of money each day and plan how you're going to use it.
                    *I would bring 5 dollars to school daily,use a dollar in the morning to buy a cocoanut water and maybe buy a low fat granola bar. 
                    I would save the rest for afterschool and buy some trail mix from a local shop to eat after school or buy before school to munch on throughout the day.
                    Try buying healthy snacks and bringing them to school to snack on.bring lots of water to drink throughout the day aswell.</li>
                <li> Bring Fruits
                    *I wouldn’t reccommend eating fruits as a snack all day long,try eating some unsweetened/unsalted nuts like cashews, almonds, pistachios but bringing them along definitely helps bring down your cravings.
                    If you search super foods there are long lists of greens and other yummy snacks you can pick and choose to munch on.
                    Things like apples,pears,grapes and pre cut fruit you can bring in tupperware and munch on throughout the day is an alternative to buy sweets and salty snacks from vending machines or fastfood  </li>
                <li> Wait outside when your friend(s) are buying food.
                    *I would always accompany my friends on our way home to buy some food and bring a minimum of money each day and plan how you're going to use it. </li>
</ul>
                <p> Exercising is fun when you try it but mentally it’s exhausting just to think about doing it.
                    Procrastination is the real culprit behind people’s lack of exercising.
                    Ways to combat laziness and actually work out are here.
<ul> 
                <li>Exercise with a friend
                    *make a schedule  with your friend(s) when both of you are free to workout.
                    You dont always need to work out with your close friends,use this oppertunity to get closer to some people.
                    Invite them out to the gym or to jog with you. </li>
                    
                <li>Put down the electronics
                    *A lot of the time we plan to work out but get caught up procrastinating by watching a tv show,
                    or chatting via text with someone. 
                    30 minutes before you want to work out,go outside and people watch.
                    or pick up a pencil and paper and draw,
                    do a puzzle,coloring book,play a board game or read a book.
                    keep yourself occupied and by the time your alarm for you to work out or get ready to 
                    work goes off you’ll feel less likely to return to your electronics and more likely to work since you are already up and ready. </li>
                    
                <li>GO straight to workout after class/work
                    Now i’m sure we all wake up bright and early to get to school or work.Instead of rushing home to crash at home,
                    head straight for the gym or park to work out. 
                    By doing this you dont have an excus to rest somewhere.
                    when you go home you can get caught up,procrastinate and maybe do a workout but not full heartedly trying to rush back home.
                    By working out after work for an hour you feel reengergized and can take a shower and meet some friends or family to hang out before going to sleep for the night. </li>
                    
 </ul>
